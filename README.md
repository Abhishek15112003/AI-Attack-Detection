# AI-Attack-Detection
AI-Based Attack Detection using Machine Learning. This project preprocesses network traffic data, selects important features, and trains a CatBoostClassifier to classify different types of cyber attacks. It includes dynamic test data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model saving for future predictions.
